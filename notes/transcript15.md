Oskar: any volunteers was here we have about 27 people here. Igor Igor do you will take notes?
Corey: I will take notes.
Oskar: great thank you so much cool. Im are you live on YouTube yet ?
Status.im:  I'm having some issues with YouTube but I'm going to say I recorded it and I'm working on getting it started right now so if anything
I will upload the video later if it if I'm still running into some issues yes sir yeah.
Oskar: Okay
Igor: There is a notes doc in the zoom chatroom. 
Oskar: In the group chat and in the status core dev channel.
Igor: Oh yeah. I see the notes.
Oskar: cool so yeah thank you and welcome to the 15th core dev call. Let’s brief in things that hasn't been mentioned in the last Town Hall that you think other people should know about and then we could talk briefly about partition with the topic compatibility, Status Go as the next package, briefly on cares unicorn, quickly follow up with better pull request process and then we had a call month or so ago and then if there are any announcements. Before we get started, is there anything else people would like to talk about? All right cool. So will start with the small bits. So a set of things new, that hasn’t been mentioned in the last Town Hall, um.. Sticker Market?

02:22
Julien: yeah pretty much nothing in the sticker market front. We are almost done, just waiting for contract audit. So not much on the development side.
Corey: We gonna be waiting on coordination on the troubled bits which is starting. Meeting with them this weekend. Then they've already looked at that audit metrics that I set up that looks at all the functionality and understand that attribute talk and sticker market are the first on the list.
Oskar: Alright. Tribute to Talk. 
Eric: Yeah the contract was updated so that it can be deprecated in the future and the message personalized message for attributed talk has been replaced by a hash for ipfs so that instead of just having a message, we can have a bunch of metadata including the message and store it on ipfs and yeah that's it for Tribute to Talk.
Oskar: Dapp Store.
Corey: Real Quick about the Sticker Market, I wanna ask, there were a couple changes that were that were happening with regards to the contract. Are those done or are they still in progress?
Julien: Right so Ricardo did like a very simple change and it's done as far as I know. So yeah it should be aligned in the report now. 
Rachel: What about the changes to controlling the package? It was on list.

Julien: Right so there is this change that Ricardo did recently.  I think he sent an email like last Friday or so. I don’t remember and I understand he did it.
Rachel: okay
Oskar: Alright. Dapp Store. 
Oskar: Okay. Teller Network. 
Iuri: So we are trying to put the dapp in Rinkeby and we are debugging some deployment issues that are happening namely with some caching issues that was happening on the client side. We fixed this issue with the S&T token that we found. I mean we did a little bit of a lot of small fixes here and there and and was the goal right now is to get it working 100% in Rinkeby.
Oskar: Alright. Network Incentivization.
Igor: So yeah basically the goal for this week is to make an end-to-end very like simple proof of concept. So essentially the whole sort of flow from running a mail server in our case right now it's a status node and registering it for now while it's some sort of a closed beta and then using it in the app so essentially to have this flow of no incentivization but it is the flow around your custom node and you can use it in status in a more or less convenient way. This kind of this side of it and we started with a contract that. Actually Andreas started and we have a help from Ricardo as a mentor. Essentially doing this. Yeah that that's it and then we'll work. So right now the contract part is yeah it's even deployed but we'll work on status going status react integrate with this contract. Yeah that's the next step. And then we'll do some implementation there or like some probably stab implementation of subscription just to have some UX feedback from it. That’s it.
Oskar: All right. Cool. Token economics. There was a great presentation  at last time also. Probably not in the new update or so I guess. 
Barry: I wasn't prepared to kind of presented anything especially since I kind of monopolize last week's call but yeah there's there's still a lot of ongoing work. there's you know books I would just stress that I would have teams continue to think about sort of well one on a broad level what's the probability, what are the factors that influence the probability of a project failing and then just about you know your the your own specific drivers a value yeah and we're thinking about maybe starting to publish some of our research maybe as blog posts to try to get a broader feedback yeah outside of status.
Oskar: Awesome. Core Improvements. Is there anything outside of unicorn preparation 
Igor: Yeah it was one zero release testing and things and we actually decided that after this discussion discuss post to have a no-go for the current implementation of topic partitioning we'll discuss it later but yeah that's just for the information. So we will not enable it in 0 11 0. That's all for me.
Oskar: Cool. Right. I can do protocol briefly um don't freaking mention something. So we had we had this panel in if you see a few weeks ago and that sort of work is ongoing to some more long-term mix that kind of based approach and we are trying to collaborate with with some more groups of people and so on and we're gonna have a call similar to the fm2 call quite similar to this call. As we discussed, it’s gonna be tomorrow and then we'll have it every other week. We'll see how it goes. And then there's been as some of you have seen, some sort of the data synchronization resource log I started a week or two ago with the goal of sort of taking a step back and looking at sort of existing literature when it comes to data replication and so on to sort of see all the various alternatives and try to categorize them and understand the trade-offs more in a better way. So I'll keep working on that and getting a better sort of comparison and then see what comes out of that. And then one sort of there's a better on say of that then resume proof of concepts and figure out a plan for getting it into Dapp. And if anyone has any comments or thoughts on that either here or we can do it in private.
Oskar: All right. cool.
Barry: So liquid funding. There's that initial there's the project page that that's basically done where a project it can be displayed, um sort of in a more Kickstarter like format and now there's a actual checkout for for the back this project completed I think maybe perhaps a stretch goal to try for it is to create a page that would easily allow someone to create their own project page, not just view one and back one. Maybe in time for build week and we might be able to dog food it with different people and teams inside of status store during build week uploading their projects to using liquid funding. So that sort of a stretch goal we'll see if we can get that we can get that built in this next week or not.
Oskar: All right. Anything from core browser or chat. Anything from desktop wallet or key card.
Eric: I can make a small update for chat. What we've done that concerns other teams. So there is the the typographic component that has been implemented. So from now on it's better to use this instead of font type and font font size and all these font related parameters when implementing CSS and unless it's a very specific component that doesn't have a known typography. But basically all the typography available in Sigma are usable through the typography attribute in CSS. And the other thing is that soon we will merge a PR that introduce system tags which is now the preferred way for adding information to context like is the contact blocked or added or contact request has been received, that kind of stuff. And that's all for me.
Julien: I can say a few word for the browser team. I was meeting them before um so yeah because we are mostly done with sticker market, now we take this opportunity to push a bit more extension and the short term goal is to have extension out of alpha so that's behind the flag and usable directly. So that means mostly nailing error handling and permission mechanism. And also with we plan to crucially a little bit the developer experience just to make sure it's easier to create extension. So if you have any kind of an opinion or ideas around how to handle permission or error handling, I'm interested in your feedback.
Oskar: I'm curious, is there any plan or research around making sensors so so you could use the dinners of different environment whether that would be like some JavaScript API or I don't know what it would look like but making it so it could be implemented in other clients where closed script is not so first-class system. 
Julien: So it's not like the target we have is short term but it's definitely something we keep in mind so just to make sure that we don't introduce feature that would make this more complex. So I think that there's nothing that prevents implementing the runtime in different languages because it's mostly data and then semantic applied to to this data and there is no our dependency on JavaScript for instance as of now. So we are definitely something that we keep in mind.
Rachel: It's also worth plugging that Julian today's write up for this next phase of extensions to kind of lay out some of the short term short term which is in this one folder.
Oskar: Awesome. Anything from wallet or key card
